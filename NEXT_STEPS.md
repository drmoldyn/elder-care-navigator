## Week 1: Core Infrastructure (THIS WEEK)

### Day 1: Database Migration & Data Import

**1. Apply Database Migration to Supabase**
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Database ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Enable "postgis"
# 2. SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
# 3. Copy/paste content from: supabase/migrations/0002_add_geolocation_and_medical_systems.sql
# 4. Run migration
```

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ PostGIS extension enabled
- ‚úÖ Resources table enhanced with geolocation, insurance, provider fields
- ‚úÖ Medical systems table created
- ‚úÖ Proximity relationship table created
- ‚úÖ Spatial functions and indexes active

**2. Download CMS Data (5 minutes)**
```bash
./scripts/download-cms-data.sh
```

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ 11,000+ home health agencies
- ‚úÖ 15,000+ nursing homes
- ‚úÖ 6,000+ hospice providers
- ‚úÖ 6,000+ hospitals
- Files saved in `data/cms/`

**3. Process CMS Data (2 minutes)**
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/process-cms-data.ts
```

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Data mapped to our schema
- ‚úÖ Processed files in `data/cms/processed/`
- ‚úÖ Ready for import (without geocoding initially for speed)

**4. Import Initial Dataset (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Import without geocoding first (fast track)
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-enhanced.ts data/cms/processed/home-health-processed.csv
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-enhanced.ts data/cms/processed/nursing-homes-processed.csv
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-enhanced.ts data/cms/processed/hospice-processed.csv
```

**Expected outcome:**
- ‚úÖ 32,000+ resources in database
- ‚úÖ Organized by insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Organized by state, city, ZIP code
- ‚è≥ Geocoding (run later in background)

### Day 2-3: Update UI to Display Resources

**1. Update Results Page (`src/app/results/[sessionId]/page.tsx`)**

**Current:** Shows only AI guidance, placeholder for resources

**New features needed:**
- Display actual matched resources from database
- Show insurance acceptance badges (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, VA)
- Display facility details (address, phone, rating, services)
- Group by provider type (nursing home, home health, etc.)
- Add "Contact Facility" CTA (email capture for lead gen)
- Show proximity to medical systems (once migration applied)

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Fetch matched resources from database
const { data: resources } = await supabase
  .from('resources')
  .select('*')
  .in('id', session.matched_resources);

// Display resource cards with:
// - Facility name, type, address
// - Insurance badges
// - Quality rating (CMS stars)
// - Contact CTA (email gate)
```

**2. Create Facility Detail Page (`src/app/facility/[id]/page.tsx`)**

**Features:**
- Full facility information (all fields from database)
- Map showing location
- Nearby medical systems (once proximity data available)
- Services and specialties
- Insurance acceptance details
- "Request Information" form (lead capture)
- "Call Now" button (click tracking)

**3. Add Resource Filtering to Navigator**

**Enhance search with:**
- Insurance type selector (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, VA)
- Provider type filter (nursing home, assisted living, home health, etc.)
- Quality rating filter (4+ stars)
- Distance radius (5, 10, 25, 50 miles from ZIP)

### Day 4-5: Lead Capture Infrastructure

**1. Create Lead Capture Flow**

**Email gate on:**
- "See contact information" button
- "Request tour" button
- "Download comparison PDF" button

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Modal/form to capture email
// Store lead in database
// Send lead to facility (future: via email or API)
// Track conversion (facility reports back)
```

**2. Create Leads Table (if not exists)**

Already exists in schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE leads (
  id uuid,
  session_id uuid,
  lead_type text,
  name text,
  email text,
  phone text,
  zip_code text,
  message text,
  urgency text,
  sent_to_provider text,
  status text
);
```

**3. Build Lead Tracking Dashboard (MVP)**

**Simple admin page:**
- List of leads captured
- Facility they're interested in
- Lead source (which search/page)
- Status (new, contacted, converted)

## Week 2: Content & SEO

### State Landing Pages (Auto-Generated)

**Create:** `src/app/[state]/page.tsx`

**Auto-generate 50 pages:**
- California Elder Care Resources
- Texas Nursing Homes & Assisted Living
- Florida Senior Care Facilities
- etc.

**Content from database:**
- "X facilities in [State]"
- "Insurance accepted: Medicare, Medicaid, Private, VA"
- Top cities with most facilities
- Link to search filtered by state

### Core Blog Posts (SEO)

**Write 20-30 articles targeting:**
1. "How to Choose a Nursing Home That Accepts Medicare"
2. "Assisted Living vs. Skilled Nursing: What's Covered by Insurance?"
3. "Finding Home Health Agencies Near Major Hospitals"
4. "Hospital Discharge Planning: 72-Hour Checklist"
5. "Medicare Coverage for Nursing Homes: Complete Guide"
6. "[State] Medicaid Long-Term Care Benefits"
7. "VA Benefits for Elder Care: What's Covered?"
8. "How to Find Elder Care Near Your Parent's Doctor"
9. "Cost of Nursing Home Care by State (2025)"
10. "Emergency Elder Care Placement: What to Do in 48 Hours"

**SEO optimization:**
- Target long-tail keywords (less competition)
- Link to search with pre-filled filters
- Include state-specific information
- Email capture via "Download Checklist" CTAs

### Crisis Mode Landing Page

**Create:** `/crisis` or `/hospital-discharge`

  data/cms/geocoded/home-health-geocoded.csv \
  --compute-proximity
```

### 2. Add Assisted Living Dataset
