### üè† Home Health Agencies

**Source**: CMS Medicare.gov Provider Data

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total facilities | 13,741 | 100.0% |
| With CCN identifiers | 13,741 | 100.0% |

## Scoring Methodology (v2 - VERIFIED CORRECT)

### Two Distinct Metrics

**1. SunsetWell Score (`overall_score`)**:
- **Definition**: Non-normalized weighted composite score (0-100 scale)
- **Purpose**: Absolute quality measure based on facility performance
- **Calculation**:
  1. Calculate weighted z-scores for each metric within peer group
  2. Sum weighted z-scores: `composite_z = Œ£(weight √ó z_score)`
  3. Normalize to 0-100 scale: `score = 50 + (composite_z √ó 25)`
  4. Clamp to range: `max(0, min(100, score))`
- **Example**: A facility with excellent staffing (z=+2) and good inspections (z=+1) might score 75

**2. Percentile Rank (`overall_percentile`)**:
- **Definition**: Peer-group relative ranking (0-100)
- **Purpose**: Shows where facility ranks compared to similar facilities in same state
- **Calculation**: Rank facility's `overall_score` within peer group (state + provider_type)
- **Example**: Score of 75 might be 85th percentile in competitive state, 95th percentile in less competitive state

### Metric Weights

**For Nursing Homes** (weighted composite):
- Inspection & Compliance: 53% (`health_inspection_rating`)
- Staffing: 14% (`staffing_rating`)
- Nurse Hours: 9% each (`total_nurse_hours_per_resident_per_day`, `rn_hours_per_resident_per_day`)
- Staff Turnover: 6% + 4% (`total_nurse_staff_turnover`, `rn_turnover`)
- Quality Measures: 5% (`quality_measure_rating`)

**For Assisted Living** (adapted weights):
- State inspection results
- Staffing adequacy
- License status and compliance

### Peer Group Hierarchy

Scores are calculated within peer groups (for fair comparison):
1. **Primary**: State + Provider Type (e.g., "CA nursing_home")
2. **Fallback**: Census Division + Provider Type
3. **Last Resort**: National + Provider Type

### Technical Implementation

**Correct Script**: `scripts/calculate-sunsetwell-scores-full.ts`
- Generates BOTH `overall_score` (absolute) AND `overall_percentile` (relative)
- Uses proper z-score normalization within peer groups
- Verified correct methodology in v2 scores (99% of facilities show score ‚â† percentile)

**Incorrect Script** (DO NOT USE): `scripts/normalize-facility-metrics.ts`
- Bug: Replaces weighted composite with just percentile rank
- Result: overall_score = overall_percentile (wrong!)
- This script is for metric normalization only, not final scoring

## Verification Scripts

The following scripts were used to verify these counts:

1. **check-provider-types.ts**: Confirms total facility counts by type
2. **comprehensive-facility-inventory.ts**: Full inventory with data quality metrics
3. **quick-score-check.ts**: Rapid verification of score coverage
4. **diagnose-score-discrepancy.ts**: Detailed analysis of scoring coverage

All scripts use proper pagination to avoid Supabase's 1,000-row default limit.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Pagination bugs in Supabase queries (was capping at 1,000 rows)
- ‚úÖ State population for peer grouping (now 100% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Score calculation for all facility types with data

### In Progress üöß
- üöß Home health CMS quality data import
- üöß Hospice agency data acquisition

### Future Enhancements üîÆ
- Score category breakdowns (quality, staffing, safety subscores)
- Historical score tracking and trending
- Automated nightly score refresh pipeline
