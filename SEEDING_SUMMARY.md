# Resource Seeding Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

A complete data pipeline infrastructure to seed **thousands of elder care resources** organized by insurance coverage, geolocation, and proximity to major medical systems (within 120 miles).

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema

**New Migration:** `supabase/migrations/0002_add_geolocation_and_medical_systems.sql`

**Enhancements to `resources` table:**
- ✅ Geolocation fields (address, city, state, ZIP, county, lat/long)
- ✅ PostGIS geography point for spatial queries
- ✅ Insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, VA)
- ✅ Provider identification (facility_id, NPI, provider_type)
- ✅ Facility characteristics (beds, ownership, quality rating, services, specialties)

**New tables:**
- ✅ `medical_systems` - Major hospitals and medical centers
- ✅ `resource_medical_proximity` - Precomputed distances within 120 miles

**New functions:**
- ✅ `calculate_distance_miles()` - Distance calculation between geography points
- ✅ `find_medical_systems_within_radius()` - Find hospitals within X miles
- ✅ `compute_resource_medical_proximity()` - Precompute proximity relationships

**Indexes:**
- ✅ GiST spatial indexes on geolocation fields
- ✅ B-tree indexes on ZIP code, city, state, provider_type
- ✅ Composite indexes on insurance coverage fields

### 2. Data Collection Scripts

**Download Script:** `scripts/download-cms-data.sh`
- Downloads 4 CMS datasets (~38,000 facilities)
- Home Health Agencies, Nursing Homes, Hospice, Hospitals
- Free, public domain data

**Processing Script:** `scripts/process-cms-data.ts`
- Maps CMS fields to our enhanced schema
- Handles 4 different CMS data formats
- Outputs standardized CSV files

**Geocoding Script:** `scripts/geocode-addresses.ts`
- Uses free US Census Geocoding API
- Adds lat/long coordinates to addresses
- Fallback to ZIP code centroids
- Rate-limited to 1 req/sec

**Enhanced Import Script:** `scripts/import-resources-enhanced.ts`
- Supports all new schema fields
- Upsert mode for updates
- Optional proximity computation
- Comprehensive error handling

## Data Sources Identified

### Federal (CMS)
- ✅ Home Health Agencies: 11,474 records
- ✅ Nursing Homes: 15,000+ records
- ✅ Hospice Providers: 6,000+ records
- ✅ Hospitals: 6,000+ records
- **Total CMS:** ~38,000 facilities

### Academic/Open Data
- ✅ Assisted Living (GitHub): 44,638 facilities
- ✅ State databases (CA, IL, NY, FL, TX): 15,000+ facilities
- **Total Additional:** ~60,000 facilities

### **Grand Total Available:** 90,000+ elder care resources

## Organization Capabilities

### By Insurance Coverage

All resources tagged with:
- `medicare_accepted` (boolean)
- `medicaid_accepted` (boolean)
- `private_insurance_accepted` (boolean)
- `veterans_affairs_accepted` (boolean)

**Query example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM resources
WHERE medicare_accepted = true
  AND provider_type = 'home_health'
  AND state = 'CA';
```

### By Geolocation

All resources with:
- Full address fields (street, city, state, ZIP, county)
- Coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- PostGIS geography points for spatial queries

**Query example:**
```sql
-- Find resources within 50 miles
SELECT *, calculate_distance_miles(
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-118.2437, 34.0522), 4326)::geography,
  geolocation
) as distance
FROM resources
WHERE ST_DWithin(
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-118.2437, 34.0522), 4326)::geography,
  geolocation,
  50 * 1609.34
)
ORDER BY distance ASC;
```

### By Medical System Proximity

Resources linked to hospitals within 120 miles:

**Query example:**
```sql
-- Find nursing homes near teaching hospitals
SELECT r.*, ms.name as hospital, rmp.distance_miles
FROM resources r
JOIN resource_medical_proximity rmp ON r.id = rmp.resource_id
JOIN medical_systems ms ON rmp.medical_system_id = ms.id
WHERE ms.is_teaching_hospital = true
  AND r.provider_type = 'nursing_home'
  AND rmp.distance_miles <= 120
ORDER BY rmp.distance_miles;
```

## Home Health & Home Support Services

### CMS Home Health Agencies (11,474)
- Medicare-certified agencies
- Full address and contact info
- Services offered (nursing, PT, OT, ST, MSW, aides)
- State-by-state coverage

### State-Licensed Home Care
- Illinois: Home services, home nursing agencies
- California: All licensed home care providers
- New York: Licensed home care services (1,400+)
- Downloadable CSV datasets

### CNA Registries (Research Complete)
- **Finding:** No bulk downloads available
- All states have individual lookup portals only
- Would require formal data requests or web scraping
- NPPES NPI database has 75,000+ CNAs with taxonomy code 376K00000X

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (30 minutes to 38,000 resources)

1. **Enable PostGIS** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Apply migration:** Run `0002_add_geolocation_and_medical_systems.sql`
3. **Download data:** `./scripts/download-cms-data.sh` (5 min)
4. **Process data:** `pnpm tsx scripts/process-cms-data.ts` (2 min)
5. **Import data:** `pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-enhanced.ts data/cms/processed/*.csv` (10 min)

### Full Pipeline (with geocoding - 11+ hours)

Same as above, but add geocoding step between process and import:

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/geocode-addresses.ts \
  data/cms/processed/home-health-processed.csv \
  data/cms/geocoded/home-health-geocoded.csv
```

Run overnight or over weekend.

## Performance Characteristics

### Geocoding Bottleneck
- Census API: ~1 request/second (free tier)
- 38,000 addresses = ~11 hours
- **Solution:** Run in background, or use paid API (Google/Mapbox)

### Database Performance
- PostGIS spatial indexes enable fast radius queries
- Precomputed proximity table avoids real-time calculations
- GIN indexes on arrays for services/specialties
- Expected query times: <100ms for most queries

### Scalability
- Current pipeline: 90,000+ resources
- Can scale to millions with:
  - NPPES full dataset (8.8M providers)
  - Commercial datasets
  - Batch geocoding services

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Apply migration to Supabase
2. ✅ Download CMS data
3. ✅ Process and import (without geocoding for speed)
4. ✅ Verify data in database
5. ✅ Update UI to display resources

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Run geocoding overnight
2. Import hospitals to medical_systems table
3. Compute proximity relationships
4. Add assisted living dataset (44,638 facilities)
5. Implement UI filters for insurance, location, proximity

### Long-term (Ongoing)
1. Quarterly CMS updates (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
2. Add state databases (CA, IL, NY, FL, TX)
3. Enhance with quality metrics, inspection data
4. Add user reviews and ratings
5. Implement advanced search (services, specialties, languages)
