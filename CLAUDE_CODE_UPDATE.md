# Update Summary for Claude Code

## Critical Fixes
- Moved `@supabase/supabase-js` into runtime dependencies to keep Supabase client available in production builds.
- Introduced a care-type step in the navigator and expanded SQL/geocoded matchers to surface facility and home-service providers based on the new preference.

## High-Priority Fixes
- Renamed duplicate Supabase migrations (`0002` → `0002/0003/0004`) and added `0005_add_care_type_to_user_sessions.sql` so Prisma/Supabase history stays linear.
- Reworked the results page to show matches immediately, surface the AI guidance in a collapsible banner, and keep polling without blocking UI.

## Medium-Priority Fixes
- Hardened `/api/request-info` by ignoring client timestamps and relying on server defaults.
- Captured email marketing opt-in end-to-end: schema, navigator review step, Supabase insert, and guidance generation now propagate `emailSubscribed`.

## Additional Notes
- Added new `CareTypeStep` UI component and updated review step UX for the email opt-in flow.
- Folded in the service-area tooling (migration + import scripts) and renumbered the service-area migration to `0006_create_service_areas.sql` to sit after the new `0003`–`0005` sequence.

## Step Follow-Up
- Ran `pnpm install` to pull runtime/dev deps and reran `pnpm lint` (now clean after typing the matchers and adding script-level directives).
- Prepared migrations `0003`, `0004`, `0005`, and `0006` for Supabase; direct execution still requires project credentials, so run them via the Supabase SQL editor or CLI when you have access.

## Latest Progress (This Sync)
- Merged the care-type matching flow with the service-area feature set inside `/Users/dtemp/Desktop/nonnie-world` and removed the need to juggle two divergent repos.
- Renumbered the service-area migration to `0006_create_service_areas.sql` and updated all scripts/docs; earlier migrations (`0003`–`0005`) now reflect the geolocation/info-request/care-type additions.
- Ported navigator, API, and results-page enhancements so facilities and home services render side-by-side (distance vs "serves your area" treatments) without interrupting the ongoing geocoding import.
- Installed dependencies in the unified repo and confirmed `pnpm lint` passes with the new typing/ESLint directives.

## Suggestions & Next Actions
1. **Run the new migrations** (`0003` → `0006`) in Supabase, then execute `pnpm tsx scripts/import-service-areas.ts` to load the 528k ZIP mappings once the current geocoding task finishes.
2. **Smoke test the merged navigator/results flow** (facility-only, home-service-only, and mixed care types) to confirm the UI separation and comparison bar still behave as expected.
3. **Document migration/import timing** after execution so future runs know the order and expected duration.
