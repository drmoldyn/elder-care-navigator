# Next Steps Summary (CA + FL + TX + CO + NY + MN)

- `analysis/alf-sunsetwell/data/alf_scores_v1.csv` contains interim percentiles for CA, FL, TX, CO, NY, and MN licensing feeds.
- Embedding/visuals (`umap_embedding.csv`, `umap_state_scatter.png`, `umap_complaints.png`) now cover all six states.
- TX, CO, NY, and MN datasets currently include licensing + capacity only; inspection/violation metrics remain outstanding (requires HHSC/CDPHE/NY DOH/MDH requests or scoped scrapers).
- Supabase upload still pending until the Supabase client library is available in this environment.
