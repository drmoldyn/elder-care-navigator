      "qualityLandscape": "Austin's skilled nursing landscape shows significant quality challenges throughout the market. With 0 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 0.0, families have limited but focused options to consider. 0% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nQuality is relatively consistent across the market, though families should still verify current inspection reports and tour facilities personally.",
      "supplyDemand": "Austin has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 0 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "Texas' less stringent regulatory environment creates variable quality across markets, making careful facility evaluation essential.\n\nAustin's market reflects regional challenges common in competitive healthcare markets. Families may want to consider expanding their search radius to access higher-quality facilities in neighboring markets.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Austin appears to have limited Medicaid acceptance among tracked facilities. Families requiring Medicaid coverage should contact facilities directly to verify bed availability, as acceptance policies change frequently. Consider consulting with TX Department of Health and Human Services for Medicaid-certified facility listings."

      {
        "question": "What should I look for during facility tours?",
        "answer": "When visiting facilities, many families find it helpful to observe how staff interact with residents throughout the day. You might notice whether staff members are attentive and kind, or if they seem rushed and impersonal. It's also worth paying attention to how residents look and whether they appear clean, well-groomed, and engaged in their surroundings. The overall atmosphere can tell you a lot—some families watch for whether the facility feels fresh and well-maintained or if there are concerning odors. Things to watch for that can help you feel more confident in your choice include seeing residents participating in activities, observing clean common areas and resident rooms, and getting straightforward answers when you ask about staffing levels. Some families become concerned when a facility has immediate availability while others have waitlists, or if staff seem evasive when discussing their inspection history. Many families choose to visit at different times of day, including evenings and weekends, to get a fuller picture of daily life at the facility.",

        "answer": "Austin nursing home costs average $266/day ($7,980/month) but vary significantly by quality tier. Premium facilities (90+ score): $532/day. Excellent options (75-89): $399/day.

        "category": "cost"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I pay for long-term nursing home care?",
        "answer": "Many families navigate nursing home costs by using a combination of funding sources. Medicare can cover up to 100 days following a hospitalization for skilled nursing care, which gives families time to plan for longer-term arrangements. For ongoing care, TX Medicaid can help cover costs if your loved one's assets are below $2,000, though the application process typically takes 45-60 days, so many families find it helpful to apply early. If you have long-term care insurance, most facilities will accept those policies. Veterans and their spouses may qualify for Aid and Attendance benefits, which can provide up to $2,431 per month toward care costs. Some families choose to pay privately using savings or home equity. A strategy many families use is to start with Medicare's 100-day benefit, then transition to Medicaid if eligible. If you're planning ahead, consulting with an elder law attorney 6-12 months before placement can help you understand options for protecting assets while qualifying for assistance programs.",

      {
        "question": "How often should I visit after placement?",
        "answer": "Your presence can make a tremendous difference in how your loved one adjusts to their new home. In those early days and weeks, frequent visits help them feel less alone during a significant transition. Your familiar face and voice provide comfort and reassurance when everything else feels new and unfamiliar. Many families find that being there regularly helps their loved one begin to trust the staff and feel more secure in their new environment. As you spend time with them, you'll naturally notice how they're settling in—whether they seem comfortable, whether their basic needs are being met, and whether they're forming connections with caregivers and other residents. Your ongoing presence isn't just about checking on care; it's about maintaining your relationship and letting them know they haven't been forgotten. You might share meals together, take walks if they're able, or simply sit and talk about their day. These visits help you understand their emotional state and whether they're finding moments of contentment in their new routine. When you're there, you can also notice the small things that matter to their comfort—whether they're warm enough, whether their favorite belongings are within reach, or whether they need help advocating for something they're hesitant to ask staff about. Trust your instincts about what your loved one needs from you, and don't hesitate to speak up if something concerns you about their wellbeing or safety.",
