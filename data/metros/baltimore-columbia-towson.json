      "qualityLandscape": "Baltimore's skilled nursing landscape shows variable quality requiring careful evaluation. With 3 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 63.5, families have limited but focused options to consider. 33% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating moderate availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by CHESTNUT GRN HLTH CTR BLAKEHUR (score: 89), which ranks in the 100th percentile among peer facilities. FRANKLIN WOODS CENTER (51) and FUTURE CARE SANDTOWN-WINCHESTER (51) provide additional quality options for families seeking excellence.\n\nQuality is relatively consistent across the market, though families should still verify current inspection reports and tour facilities personally.",
      "supplyDemand": "Baltimore has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 3 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "Maryland's proximity to federal healthcare centers and robust state inspection programs typically produce above-average quality outcomes.\n\nBaltimore's market reflects mixed regional dynamics with both strong performers and facilities facing challenges. While top-tier options exist, families may need to balance quality preferences with availability and location convenience.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 2 of 3 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nMD Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
