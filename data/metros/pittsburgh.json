      "qualityLandscape": "Pittsburgh's skilled nursing landscape shows significant quality challenges throughout the market. With 2 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 22.4, families have limited but focused options to consider. 0% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by JOHN J KANE REGIONAL CENTER-RO (score: 24), which ranks in the 16th percentile among peer facilities. CARNEGIE PARK POST ACUTE (20) provides additional quality options for families seeking excellence.\n\nHowever, 2 facilities score below 40, indicating significant quality concerns. The 4-point gap between highest and lowest-rated facilities highlights the importance of thorough evaluation.",
      "supplyDemand": "Pittsburgh has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 2 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "Pennsylvania's mix of urban and rural facilities shows significant quality variation, with Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metros generally outperforming smaller markets.\n\nPittsburgh's market reflects regional challenges common in competitive healthcare markets. Families may want to consider expanding their search radius to access higher-quality facilities in neighboring markets.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 2 of 2 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nPA Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
