      "qualityLandscape": "Portland's skilled nursing landscape shows variable quality requiring careful evaluation. With 8 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 51.9, families have limited but focused options to consider. 25% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating moderate availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by MIRABELLA PORTLAND (score: 89), which ranks in the 100th percentile among peer facilities. HOLLADAY PARK PLAZA (85) and AVAMERE REHABILITATION OF HILLSBORO (55) provide additional quality options for families seeking excellence.\n\nHowever, 2 facilities score below 40, indicating significant quality concerns. The 69-point gap between highest and lowest-rated facilities highlights the importance of thorough evaluation.",
      "supplyDemand": "Portland has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 8 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "Oregon facilities benefit from strong state oversight and community-based care initiatives, though smaller markets like Portland face capacity constraints.\n\nPortland's market reflects mixed regional dynamics with both strong performers and facilities facing challenges. While top-tier options exist, families may need to balance quality preferences with availability and location convenience.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 6 of 8 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nOR Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
