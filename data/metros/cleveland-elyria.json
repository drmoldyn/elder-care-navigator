With 1 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 41.0, families have limited but focused options to consider. 0% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by CLEVELAND CARE AND REHAB CENTER (score: 41), which ranks in the 39th percentile among peer facilities. \n\nQuality is relatively consistent across the market, though families should still verify current inspection reports and tour facilities personally.",
      "supplyDemand": "Cleveland has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 1 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "OH offers a range of skilled nursing options with quality varying by location and ownership structure.\n\nCleveland's market reflects regional challenges common in competitive healthcare markets. Families may want to consider expanding their search radius to access higher-quality facilities in neighboring markets.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 1 of 1 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nOH Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
