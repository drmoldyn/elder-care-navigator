      "qualityLandscape": "Orlando's skilled nursing landscape shows significant quality challenges throughout the market. With 0 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 0.0, families have limited but focused options to consider. 0% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nQuality is relatively consistent across the market, though families should still verify current inspection reports and tour facilities personally.",
      "supplyDemand": "Orlando has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 0 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "Florida's large senior population drives competition among facilities, with quality varying significantly between tourist areas and rural regions.\n\nOrlando's market reflects regional challenges common in competitive healthcare markets. Families may want to consider expanding their search radius to access higher-quality facilities in neighboring markets.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Orlando appears to have limited Medicaid acceptance among tracked facilities. Families requiring Medicaid coverage should contact facilities directly to verify bed availability, as acceptance policies change frequently. Consider consulting with FL Department of Health and Human Services for Medicaid-certified facility listings."
