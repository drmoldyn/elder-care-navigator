With 12 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 45.5, families have moderate options to consider. 8% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by LAFAYETTE-REDEEMER, THE (score: 89), which ranks in the 100th percentile among peer facilities. WILLOWCREST (74) and SIMPSON HOUSE INC (66) provide additional quality options for families seeking excellence.\n\nHowever, 5 facilities score below 40, indicating significant quality concerns. The 77-point gap between highest and lowest-rated facilities highlights the importance of thorough evaluation.",
      "supplyDemand": "With 12 skilled nursing facilities, Philadelphia offers moderate choice for families. Top-tier facilities (scores 75+) typically have 1-3 month waitlists, while mid-tier options may have immediate availability. Early planning is advisable for quality-focused placements.",
      "regionalTrends": "Pennsylvania's mix of urban and rural facilities shows significant quality variation, with Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metros generally outperforming smaller markets.\n\nPhiladelphia's market reflects regional challenges common in competitive healthcare markets. While top-tier options exist, families may need to balance quality preferences with availability and location convenience.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 10 of 12 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nPA Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
