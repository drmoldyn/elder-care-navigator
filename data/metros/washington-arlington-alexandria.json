      "qualityLandscape": "Washington's skilled nursing landscape shows variable quality requiring careful evaluation. With 3 facilities averaging a SunsetWell score of 50.5, families have limited but focused options to consider. 0% of facilities score 75 or higher, indicating limited availability of high-performing care.\n\nThe market is led by GRANDVIEW HEALTHCARE CENTER (score: 61), which ranks in the 71th percentile among peer facilities. LEXINGTON HOUSE (59) and NAOMI HEIGHTS NURSING & REHABILITATION CENTER (31) provide additional quality options for families seeking excellence.\n\nHowever, 1 facility scores below 40, indicating significant quality concerns. The 30-point gap between highest and lowest-rated facilities highlights the importance of thorough evaluation.",
      "supplyDemand": "Washington has a relatively small skilled nursing market with just 3 facilities. This limited supply means that top-performing facilities often maintain waitlists of 2-6 months, particularly for private-pay residents. Families should start the application process early and consider expanding their search to nearby metro areas if immediate placement is needed.",
      "regionalTrends": "DC offers a range of skilled nursing options with quality varying by location and ownership structure.\n\nWashington's market reflects mixed regional dynamics with both strong performers and facilities facing challenges. Families may want to consider expanding their search radius to access higher-quality facilities in neighboring markets.",
      "medicaidAccess": "Approximately 3 of 3 facilities likely accept Medicaid residents, though acceptance varies by facility and bed availability. Higher-scoring facilities (75+) typically limit Medicaid beds to 10-30% of capacity, while lower-tier facilities may accept 60-80% Medicaid residents.\n\nDC Medicaid eligibility requires assets below $2,000 for individuals ($3,000 for couples in some states), with a 45-60 day application process. Families should apply to multiple facilities simultaneously, as Medicaid bed waitlists can extend 2-6 months at preferred facilities. Facilities scoring 60+ with Medicaid acceptance offer the best balance of quality and accessibility."
