## Profit Timeline Outlook
- **Months 1–3:** Expect modest revenue (a few thousand dollars) while lead quality is validated and the first facility partners come onboard. Focus on conversion tracking, audience building, and quick affiliate wins.
- **Months 4–6:** With optimized campaigns, sponsored placements, and an initial professional tier launch, target $8k–$12k in monthly recurring revenue as lead volume scales and affiliate deals mature.
- **Months 7–12:** As the facility portal, premium analytics, and marketplace offerings stabilize, reaching $20k–$40k MRR is realistic. Significant profit follows once CAC from paid media declines (better Quality Scores, remarketing) and high-margin subscriptions/affiliates grow.

Overall, anticipate 6–9 months to hit reliable, “significant” profit assuming steady traffic acquisition, high-quality lead delivery, and incremental rollout of the higher-value products above.
