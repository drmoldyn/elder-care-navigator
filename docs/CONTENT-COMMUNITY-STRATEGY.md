## 13. Quick Start Option: MVP Blog

If you want to **launch quickly** without full community features:

### MVP Scope (1 week)
- Static blog using MDX files (no database yet)
- 5-10 seed posts (staff-written or AI-assisted)
- Category pages (Stories, Guides)
- SEO optimization (structured data, meta tags)
- Simple "Share Your Story" email form (manual curation)

### MDX Structure
```
/content/posts/
  finding-memory-care-for-mom.mdx
  va-benefits-guide.mdx
  medicaid-planning-checklist.mdx
```

**Pros:** Fastest path to publishing, zero database work
**Cons:** Manual workflow, no comments/community yet

### Upgrade Path
- Month 2: Add Supabase posts table, migrate MDX content
- Month 3: Add comment system
- Month 4: Add user submissions

---

## Next Steps

**Decision Point:**
1. **Launch MVP blog now** (1 week, MDX-based, 5 posts)
2. **Build full Supabase blog** (3 weeks, community-ready)
3. **Defer until Phase 2A complete** (landing pages + tracking first)

**Recommended:** Start with **MVP blog in parallel** while you handle GTM setup and landing pages. Blog doesn't block monetization work and begins SEO clock immediately.
