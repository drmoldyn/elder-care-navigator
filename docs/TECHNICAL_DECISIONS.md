# Technical Decisions

This document records major technical decisions made during the development of the Elder Care Navigator project.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router for server-side rendering and routing
- **React 19**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Radix UI primitives

### Backend
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication, database, and real-time features
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database (via Supabase)

### Development Tools
- **pnpm**: Fast, disk-efficient package manager
- **ESLint**: Code linting and quality enforcement
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Next.js App Router
**Decision**: Use Next.js App Router instead of Pages Router

**Rationale**:
- Server Components by default for better performance
- Improved data fetching patterns
- Better TypeScript support
- Future-proof architecture

### 2. Supabase for Backend
**Decision**: Use Supabase instead of building a custom backend

**Rationale**:
- Rapid development with built-in authentication
- Real-time capabilities out of the box
- PostgreSQL-based for relational data
- Row-level security for data access control
- Reduces backend development overhead

### 3. TypeScript
**Decision**: Use TypeScript throughout the project

**Rationale**:
- Type safety catches errors at compile time
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through types
- Easier refactoring

### 4. Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling

**Rationale**:
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Small bundle size with purging
- Excellent developer experience

### 5. pnpm Package Manager
**Decision**: Use pnpm instead of npm or yarn

**Rationale**:
- Faster installation times
- Efficient disk space usage
- Strict dependency resolution
- Better monorepo support if needed

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a state management solution (Zustand, Redux Toolkit) as the app grows
- Evaluate adding end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress
- Consider implementing a monorepo structure if the project expands
- Explore edge functions for performance-critical operations
