# Best Nursing Homes in Portland, OR (2025)

**Quick Stats:** 7 facilities | Average Score: 56.8 | 29% High-Performing | Average Cost: $380/day

---

## Market Overview

Portland's skilled nursing landscape shows a **clear quality divide**: two exceptional facilities lead the market with near-perfect scores, while several lower-tier options struggle with health inspection and staffing challenges. With just 7 skilled nursing facilities serving the metro area, families have fewer options than in comparable cities‚Äîbut the top performers offer genuinely excellent care.

**The good news:** Portland's best facilities rank among Oregon's finest, with Mirabella Portland achieving a perfect 100 score and offering luxury-level amenities alongside clinical excellence. Holladay Park Plaza follows closely at 95, providing a strong alternative for families seeking premium care.

**The challenge:** Below the top tier, quality drops significantly. Only 2 of 7 facilities (29%) score above 75, and two facilities score below 20 due to persistent health violations and understaffing. Families should thoroughly vet mid-tier options and avoid the bottom performers entirely.

**Market dynamics:** Portland's shortage of skilled nursing beds means top facilities often have 2-4 month waitlists. Early planning is essential. Medicaid acceptance is limited among high performers‚Äînone of the top 3 accept Medicaid, creating access challenges for budget-conscious families.
