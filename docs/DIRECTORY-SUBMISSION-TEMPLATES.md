## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How long until I see traffic from these efforts?**
A: Search engine indexing is fast (24-48 hours). Directory backlinks take 1-3 months. Social media depends on your engagement (immediate to 2-3 months).

**Q: What if a directory rejects my submission?**
A: Ask why and address concerns. Often it's just lack of information. Provide more details about your data sources, nonprofit-like mission, and value to users.

**Q: Do I need to submit to all 50 state AAAs?**
A: Start with top 10 high-population states. If you get good response rates, continue to others. Quality over quantity.

**Q: Should I pay for faster listing/sponsorships?**
A: No need initially. These free methods are highly effective. Save paid options for later if organic growth is slow.

**Q: How often should I post on social media?**
A: Facebook/LinkedIn: 3-5x/week. Pinterest: Daily (10 pins/day). Quality matters more than frequency.
