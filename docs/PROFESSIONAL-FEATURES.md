## Open Questions

1. **Facility Participation**: Will facilities pay for lead generation? Or do we charge professionals only?
2. **Data Sharing**: How do we incentivize facilities to share real-time bed availability?
3. **Regulatory**: Do we need to register as a healthcare service in each state?
4. **Insurance**: Do we need E&O insurance if we're just providing information?
