# Archive Index

This folder contains historical planning documents, completed features, and deprecated guides. They are preserved for context but are not the source of truth for current implementation.

- Use `docs/` for active, canonical documentation (implementation plans, checklists, deployment steps).
- The `deprecated/` subfolder contains outdated materials superseded by newer docs.

Pointers
- AEO current docs: `docs/AEO-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `docs/AEO-CHECKLIST.md`
- Deployment: prefer the latest notes in `docs/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` if present outside `ARCHIVE/`, otherwise treat archived deployment docs as historical.

If you find conflicts between archived docs and current files, rely on current project code and top-level docs.
