## 🔄 What Needs to Happen Next

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):

**1. Apply Database Migration**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
supabase/migrations/0002_add_insurance_and_address.sql
```

**2. Import CMS Data (Start Small)**
```bash
# Import home health first (12k records)
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/home-health-processed.csv

# Then nursing homes (15k records)
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/nursing-homes-processed.csv
```

**Note:** Hospice dataset is HUGE (469k records). May want to filter/sample it or import in batches.

**3. Test End-to-End Flow**
- Navigate through the form
- Submit search
- Verify resources display on results page
- Check that insurance badges appear
- Test contact CTAs

### Short-Term (This Week):

**4. Enhance Results Page**
- Add filtering by insurance type
- Add filtering by provider type
- Add search/sort functionality
- Group resources by category

**5. Create Facility Detail Pages**
- Route: `/facility/[id]`
- Full facility information
- Map (once we have coordinates)
- Lead capture form

**6. Build Lead Capture**
- Modal for "Contact Facility" button
- Email + name capture
- Store in leads table
- This is critical for monetization!

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks):

**7. Content & SEO**
- Auto-generate state landing pages
- Write core blog posts
- Crisis mode page

**8. Geocoding (Background)**
- Run overnight for coordinates
- Enable map features
- Proximity to medical systems

**9. Monetization Launch**
- Facility outreach for lead gen pilot
- Vendor ad placements
- Sponsored listings

## 📊 Current Database State

**Resources:**
- 2 sample resources (already seeded)
- 501,647 CMS records ready to import

**Sessions:**
- Working user_sessions table
- Stores matched resources

**What's Missing:**
- Insurance and address fields (migration not yet applied)
- Bulk CMS import (ready to go once migration applied)

## 🎯 Revenue Path

**Week 1 Target:**
- 32,000+ resources live (home health + nursing homes)
- Lead capture working
- First facility outreach

**Month 1 Target:**
- 1,000 searches
- 100 email captures (10% conversion)
- 10 leads sent to facilities
- $500-1,000 first revenue

## 🚨 Critical Next Steps (In Order)

1. **Apply migration** → Adds insurance/address fields to database
2. **Import home health data** → 12,112 facilities
3. **Import nursing homes** → 14,752 facilities
4. **Test the flow** → Make sure everything displays correctly
5. **Build lead capture** → Critical for revenue
6. **Launch!** → Start getting traffic and generating leads

## 📝 Commands Reference

### Apply Migration
```bash
# Copy content from supabase/migrations/0002_add_insurance_and_address.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# Run migration
```

### Import Data
```bash
# Home health
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/home-health-processed.csv

# Nursing homes
pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/nursing-homes-processed.csv

# Hospitals (for medical systems table - future)
# pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/hospitals-medical-systems.csv

# Hospice (warning: 469k records - may want to sample)
# pnpm tsx scripts/import-resources-simple.ts data/cms/processed/hospice-processed.csv
```

### Dev Server
```bash
pnpm dev  # Running on http://localhost:3004
```

## 🎉 Major Wins Today

1. ✅ **501,647 resources ready to import** (10x more than expected!)
2. ✅ **Results page displays real resources** (not just placeholders)
3. ✅ **Simple migration ready** (no PostGIS complexity)
4. ✅ **Fast-track data pipeline** (address/ZIP, no geocoding bottleneck)
5. ✅ **Clear path to revenue** (documented strategy, monetization plan)

## 💡 Key Decision: Hospice Data

The hospice dataset is unexpectedly huge (469k records). Options:

**Option A: Import All**
- Pros: Comprehensive coverage
- Cons: Slow import, large database

**Option B: Sample/Filter**
- Take top 10k-20k hospice providers by state
- Pros: Faster, more manageable
- Cons: Less comprehensive

**Option C: Skip for MVP**
- Focus on home health + nursing homes (27k resources)
- Add hospice later
- Pros: Fastest to launch
- Cons: Missing hospice category

**Recommendation:** Start with Option C (27k resources), add hospice later in batches.

## 📈 What Success Looks Like This Week

- ✅ Migration applied
- ✅ 27,000+ resources imported
- ✅ End-to-end flow working
- ✅ Lead capture built
- ✅ First facility contacted
- ✅ Path to first $500 in revenue clear

**We're 90% there. Just need to apply migration and import data!**
