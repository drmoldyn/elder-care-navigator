# Lead Generation & Comparison Features

## 🎯 Overview

Two new revenue-generating features have been implemented:

1. **Request Info Button** - Capture leads from interested families
2. **Facility Comparison Tool** - Help users make informed decisions

---

## 📧 Request Info Button

### What It Does
- Adds a prominent "📧 Request Info" button to every facility card
- Opens a modal form to collect user information
- Stores leads in the `info_requests` table
- Sends information to facilities (when email integration is added)

### User Flow
1. User browses results → Clicks "Request Info" on a facility
2. Modal appears with form:
   - Name (required)
   - Email (required)
   - Phone (required)
   - Timeline dropdown
   - Optional message
3. User submits → Success confirmation shown
4. Lead stored in database → Facility notified (future: email)

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE info_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  message TEXT,
  timeline VARCHAR(100),
  facility_id VARCHAR(255),
  facility_name VARCHAR(500),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'new',
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Files Created

### Revenue Potential
