## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. ‚ùå Neglecting Mobile Experience
**Problem**: 60% of searches are mobile, but site is hard to use on phone
**Solution**: Test every page on mobile, ensure tap targets are 48px+, fast load times

### 2. ‚ùå Not Tracking Conversions
**Problem**: Lots of traffic but no idea what's working
**Solution**: Set up GA4 events for every important action (form starts, completions, clicks)

### 3. ‚ùå Ignoring Page Speed
**Problem**: Site loads slowly, users bounce before content loads
**Solution**: Run PageSpeed Insights monthly, keep score >85

### 4. ‚ùå Keyword Stuffing
**Problem**: Writing for search engines, not humans ("nursing homes nursing homes near me")
**Solution**: Write naturally, use keywords once in H1, a few times in body

### 5. ‚ùå No Clear CTA
**Problem**: Users don't know what to do next
**Solution**: Every page needs one primary CTA (Start Search, Read Guide, etc.)

### 6. ‚ùå Not Building Email List
**Problem**: Traffic comes and goes, no way to bring them back
**Solution**: Add lead magnets (free PDF guides), build automated email sequences

### 7. ‚ùå Forgetting About Users
**Problem**: Chasing SEO at expense of user experience
**Solution**: Prioritize helping families first, SEO second
