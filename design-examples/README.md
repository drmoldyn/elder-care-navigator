## My Recommendation

**Go with Style 1 (Airbnb-inspired)** for these reasons:

1. **Emotional connection** - Gradient feels hopeful, not clinical
2. **Modern trust** - Younger users expect modern design
3. **Mobile-first** - Looks great on phones (where most searches happen)
4. **Conversion-optimized** - Clear CTAs, strong visual hierarchy
5. **Differentiation** - Most competitor sites use Style 2 (boring healthcare aesthetic)

**BUT** - Add trust elements from Style 2:
- "✓ Data from Medicare.gov" badge
- Facility count
- "Last updated" timestamp

---

## Next Steps

1. **Pick your favorite style** (or ask for tweaks!)
2. **I'll build it in Next.js/React** with Tailwind CSS
3. **Add map integration** for search results (Google Maps)
4. **Mobile responsive** versions for all screen sizes

**Want to see:**
- Results page mockup with map view?
- Facility detail page design?
- Mobile versions of these?
